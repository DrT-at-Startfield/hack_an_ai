# hack_an_ai
The flask app framework used to drive the Startfield 'Hack and AI' Hackathon.

This code was ported from the Flask tutorial simple blog app.

The road map is to:
- Use the zappa framework to make the app serverless in AWS land
- Port the authentication process to use the AWS congnito service
- Figure out a database implementation in AWS land
- Figure out how to configure access to Bedrock (AWS' LLM service)
